need to find a set of datafiles that share the same columns. Then we can enlarge our dataset and train with a better disribution :) 

single agent screens
have max response, target, drug name, and AC50 but no cell type :( 
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12087415
-MPIE 1.0 only for syn1 and syn 5
-MPIE 4 for alll including the new syn6!

raw data - combination screens
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18457398
for each cell line: max response, cell type, target but need too join for paramenters and then for all cell lines.
use ...metadata and ...responses

^figure out how to join summaries with these
